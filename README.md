# Cursor Labs

A development workspace for exploring AI-assisted coding with Cursor IDE.

## What I've Been Exploring

- **AI Documentation Generation**: Used Cursor to generate comprehensive project documentation (PRD, implementation plans, technical guides)
- **Reddit API Integration**: Tested authentication and data fetching from Reddit's API
- **Project Planning**: Created detailed implementation plans with phased development approach
- **Agent Guidelines**: Established rules and best practices for AI-assisted development
- **Code Organization**: Explored modular architecture patterns and clean code principles

## Repository Structure

```
